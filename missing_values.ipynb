    "If there are relatively few missing entries in the data (observe e.g column with the greatest percentage of missing values), we can expect that dropping columns is unlikely to yield good results. This is because we'd be throwing away a lot of valuable data, and so imputation will likely perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there are so few missing values in the dataset, we'd expect imputation to perform better than dropping columns entirely. However, sometimes dropping columns performs slightly better! While this can probably partially be attributed to noise in the dataset, another potential explanation is that the imputation method is not a great match to this dataset. That is, maybe instead of filling in the mean value, it makes more sense to set every missing value to a value of 0, to fill in the most frequently encountered value, or to use some other method. For instance, consider a feature which indicates the year that the garage was built. It's likely that in some cases, a missing value could indicate a house that does not have a garage. Does it make more sense to fill in the median value along each column in this case? Or could we get better results by filling in the minimum value along each column? It's not quite clear what's best in this case, but perhaps we can rule out some options immediately - for instance, setting missing values in this column to 0 is likely to yield horrible results!"
